My name is Pranav Kant studying Computer Science at **National Institute of Technology Hamirpur** and will be completing my undergraduate study in 2015. I love computers and like to tweak with computers just for fun.

I love coding and know some of the languages C, JAVA. Apart from computers, I also love to play football. I am an athlete also and have participated in some athletic events in my school time. Moreover I like browsing the internet, making new contacts, configuring new softwares, getting aware of new technology.

I created this to share my knowledge, thoughts and day to day experience with you. I hope you will be enjoying your visit here by finding knowledgable material on this website. I am also trying to add more interactivity to this website but that will surely take some time since I don't focus my complete attention to this web thing and prefer to learn other things before.
