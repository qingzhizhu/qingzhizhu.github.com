# Website/Blog
This is my personal website and a blog of mine where I would be sharing my thoughts and talks related to technology. It is a static website.

## What I used ?
I used jekyll server for creating my website, which is nothing but a parsing engine. It parses the files written in particular format and generates website out of it.

I used [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://www.jekyllbootstrap.com) for reading the documentation about how to create this website. Thanks to their beautiful documentation. You can fork the source code of my website or any other website made using jekyll and create your own website out of it by making possible modifications. 

[**You can read my blog here which will give you a start in learning blogging with jekyll.**](http://www.pingmygeek.co.cc/general/blogging-for-hackers/)
