I am a passionate computer science student, currently pursuing a
Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I am interested in working with
latest technology, building applications, learning computer science
oriented stuff. I love tweaking with computers. I like to work on open
source projects, contribute to open source community in some way or
other. currently I have little experience contributing to open source
but I love even trying this out.

## About the Website

The website is made by using jekyll and some of the tweaking that I did with it. I love it. You can read my post about starting with jekyll in the blog archive if you are interested in creating such a website I have created, it takes no more than a day to fully 
setup your jekyll website and I really like it. Well in this website I have thought of putting as much posts as possible. Everyday I learn something new, so why not share all these learnings with you.

If you like this website, please consider sharing it. If not much atleast I can get more visitors/day. :)

## Contact

I like making new friends who have similar interest in Computer
Science stuff. So, please don't hesitate in contacting me either to
become my friend or for any other feedback you have in mind regarding
the website or anything you want to just speak out with me.
