Well I feel unless you don't do project on something you want to learn and fully understand, you need to do atleast a project on that thing. Further, it also gives you pleasure how things come around when you sit on your chair and work on something related to real life situations. That is the point when you understand the meaning where all this I am learning can be used around me. 

## Past Projects and small hacks.
I started with doing work on projects when I was in school. Since then, the pleasure of working on them keeps attracting me towards them and giving me new energy to do something new.

I have done work on following projects :

- **Library Management :** I created this project for my school library so that they can manage the books in the library digitally. It had all the facility like issuing books, record of books, calculating fine for students if they did not return the book on time. 
I used **JAVA** as a front-end and **MySQL** as a back-end. Overall it was nice experience with it.

- **Record Manager for Organization :** Using same **JAVA** and **MySQL**, I created one another project just before entering the college. The project elegantly manages the record for the organization. The organization was actually about selling its services and products to its customers. The software helps them in keeping a record of the payment for each of the job assigned to the organization and in keeping whole of the detail about its customers in a database rather than storing them on a paper with a pen.

- **Gist-CLI** This is a small script that helps you post the output of any file through using pipelines, files directly to the Github gist. This is really a simple tool to post a gist from the command line. You can fork my repository [HERE](https://www.github.com/pranavk/gist-cli). 


##Current Projects

Currently I am working to explore the world of Computer Science and simultaneously working on a **Project :** using Python and NoSQL databases to help travelers give more flexibility in finding information over the web.
